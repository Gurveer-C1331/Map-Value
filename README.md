# Map-Value
Map Value is an application made using the Electron framework and Google's Geochart Library (one of Google's Chart Library). The application allows the user to manipulate a map of the world by setting numeric value to different geographic region. This was a small project that allowed to me learn how to use the Google Geochart which I would use for my Animal Database project (to display geographic range of an animal). Along with learning to use Geochart library, this project gave me a chance to improve on my UI design skills by using Adobe XD to design before I wrote any code. Also this project allowed me to become more familiar with the Electron framework.

**Made using Electron, need to install Electron as dev dependency and make changes to package.json so "main.js" is the Main Process**

Concepts:
- Electron Framework
- More Javascript, CSS, HTML
- UI designing using Adobe XD
- Google Charts Library (specifically the Geochart Library)
