# Map-Value
Map Value is an application made using the Electron framework and Google's Geo chart Library (one of Google's Chart Library). The application allows the user to manipulate a map of the world by setting numeric values to different geographic regions. This was a small project that allowed me to learn how to use the Google Chart Library. This concept would be used for my Animal Database project (to display a geographic range of an animal). Also, this project gave me a chance to improve my design skills by using Adobe XD. Additionally, this project allowed me to become more familiar with the Electron framework.

**Made using Electron, need to install Electron as dev dependency and make changes to package.json so "main.js" is the Main Process**

Concepts/Skills Applied:
- Electron Framework
- More Javascript, CSS, HTML
- UI designing using Adobe XD
- Google Charts Library (specifically the Geochart Library)
